# GIT and GitHub

Git is a version control system that can be installed in the local systems.

### It is used for:

Tracking code changes
Tracking who made changes
Coding collaboration

### What does Git do?
Manage projects with Repositories

Clone a project to work on a local copy

Control and track changes with Staging and Committing

Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project

Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy

Push local updates to the main project


### Working with Git
Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository using `git init` command

Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder

When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified

You select the modified files you want to Stage

The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.

You can revert back to any previous commit.

Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

### stage and commit
One of the core functions of Git is the concepts of the Staging Environment, and the Commit.

As you are working, you may be adding, editing and removing files. But whenever you hit a milestone or finish a part of the work, you should add the files to a Staging Environment. Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on. 

Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.

When we commit, we should always include a message. By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when.


## What is GitHub?
Git is not the same as GitHub.
GitHub makes tools that use Git.
GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
